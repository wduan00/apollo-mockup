A simple MERN application that calls the [apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io/) API to recreate their Search People dashboard. Includes rudimentary filtering on job titles and company domains.

#### Limitations
1. Due to the free account policies of [render.com](https://render.com/) (the platform on which the backend is deployed), there will be a noticeable delay in the response of the first request to come in after a period of 15 minutes without traffic.
2. Apollo's free API tier restricts search results to the first 3 pages (30 people) of any given query, hence the limited results of this app.
